This is my current belief of ethics:
    All beings beings that are or were deserve respect.
    All being must have as much control over themselves as they can.
        This means that if a person's control is lost, a person may use control to bring thiers back and similar situations.
I want to study this a bit. I'm not sure if anyone else has come up with the idea of "no control" but I'm certainly keeping an eye out for it...
