This is my current belief of ethics:
    All beings beings that are or were deserve respect. This includes respect of "property".
        All people deserve the same kind and amount of respect.
        All property should be given back to society at some point.
    All being must have as much control over themselves as they can (as in a person must have as many choices as possible). Exclusions include that of others "property".
        This means that if a person's control is lost, a person may use control to bring theirs back and similar situations.
        All people must have an "elementry education", which should be compulsory, so that they learn what is essential for life - eg mathamatics, reading&writing, phychology, health, ethics&empathy, science (scientific method, understanding facts&statistics) etc - along with introductions on other things so that they may see what interests them. after that, a secondary education may be taken if that person wills, that tries their best to give as much resources as they need for them to learn what they want.
I want to study this a bit. I'm not sure if anyone else has come up with the idea of "no control" but I'm certainly keeping an eye out for it...
