This is my current belief of ethics:
    All beings beings that are or were deserve respect. This includes respect of "property".
        All property should be given back to society at some point.
    All being must have as much control over themselves as they can. Exclusions include that of others "property".
        This means that if a person's control is lost, a person may use control to bring thiers back and similar situations.
I want to study this a bit. I'm not sure if anyone else has come up with the idea of "no control" but I'm certainly keeping an eye out for it...
