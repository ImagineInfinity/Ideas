# This is my current belief of ethics
Actually it's probably not. I don't update this file as soon as a think more - I ussually just write that in notes. Belief in this is not all or nothing - if you diagree with, for example, the "except for the dignity given from the autonomy to disrespect others." thats fine. All of these things are debatable, including the names or wording that I use.

Ethics is the study of what the right action is. All actions by a moral agent that effect a moral patient concerns ethics. I currently believe that the right action is one where you do not decrease dignity unless it is to stop a patient from decreasing dignity.

## Defininitions

"Dignity" =  It is a value that every person has. Whether a person is respecting that value is subjetive to that person

"Respect" = The earned right to be treated higher than other people. An example of someone who may be treated like this would be Ghandi.

"Disrespect" = Reducing dignity of a person. Maybe not the best word. What about "injustice"?

"Person": I'm using the word "person", but you may extend this to include other animals too. Person here refers to a moral subject.

"Control": Removing choice, reducing autonomy. Appearently philosphers call it violence...

"Reducing dignity": An act causing that a persons dignity to not be valued.

"Increasing dignity": An act causing that a persons dignity to be valued. e.g. giving a compliment.

## Rules

### Rule of ?

Every person is equally deserving of dignity.

This means that no matter what skin colour, sexuality, race, belief, or age a person has; they still deserve to be treated as a person. It also means that no matter what they have done, it doesnt excempt them from needing to be treated with dignity.

### Rule of autonomy - freedom to
* Controling people decreases their dignity.
    * To be more precise, the controling of a person is inversly proportional to dignity of a person.
* Increasing a persons autonomy increases their dignity.
    * By this I mean that the more choices a person has, the more dignity they have. These choices are the choices that they make with infinite knowledge, intelligence, mental autonomy, and thinking time; and no bias.
    * The autonomy of a person is proprtional to the dignity of a person. Same relationship as above, except inversed.

### Rule of dignity - freedom from
* Every person must have the most amount of dignity that can be had simultaneously except for the dignity given from the autonomy to disrespect others.
    * Therefore increasing digity includes controling people to stop disrespect or removing peoples ability to disrespect.

## Notes

Is controling wrong because it causes suffering? If so, then how is this different to utilitarianism?

Vectors are useful to explain control, except rather than a direction, a person is used. A vector going in a direction would represent disrespecting a person, while a vector is going in the opposite direction to that vector to cancel it out, and that is justice, but if it's magnitude is larger than that other vector, it is controling too much. I do not know if it is possible to attribute a number to a magnitude, but you should be able to tell if the magnitude of one vector is bigger or smaller than another (ie. if a person is disrespecting more or less than another)

Autonomy may be right because then you can get whatever you intrinsicly want. We don't just intrinsicly want plesure which is why *Brave New World* and the experiance machine is unappealing. Bernard Marx wants things other than what he is getting and so is unsatisfied, and the person in the experiance machine is only experiancing fulfilling what ever they are intrinsicaly motivated by, but don't actually fulfil it.

## Examples

* Lies are wrong, unless it is to stop disrespect or doesn't disrespect anyone.
* Killing a person is wrong because their autonomy is taken away (because they're dead) and you take dignity away by makeing them suffer (that is, if they suffer). Gruesome murders are also disrespectful as it causes suffering.
* Rape is wrong because you take away autonomy and massivly decrease dignity.
* Children do not have the ablitity to make choices that they actually do truly want. That is why parents, who have a better understanding of the world and have more developed brains, make desisions for them. 
* If abortion is wrong because the future person won't be able to do stuff, becaue they won't exist, then a male wearing pants that are too tight would be unethical - you always have the chance to create life. And so it boils down to personhood - abortion is only wrong if what is killed is a person.
* If torturing a person causes millions of people to have a miniscule increase in dignity, it will barely count to maximizing those peoples dignity and therefore not worth it.
* If there was a person that could be killed to harvest the organs to save 5 people, then you are disrespecting that person by killing them.
* A person wanted to have chinese for their birthday, but everyone else hates chinese. If someone eats the food because they were forced, then they lose dignity (probably not by alot). Those people that hate the food may also be disrespected if they eat the food they hate, but that is their fault unless they were forced (possibly by the pressure to look like they are enjoying the choice to eat chinese)
* Forcing someone to show a person respect is wrong.
* It is right to cure or help a person for obssessing if they have OCD because it is not what they truely want to do, and is not what they would do if they had full mental autonomy.
* All people must have an education, which should be compulsory, so that they learn what is essential for life - eg mathamatics, reading&writing, phychology, health, ethics&empathy, science (scientific method, understanding facts&statistics) etc - along with introductions on other things so that they may see what interests them. After that, a secondary education may be taken if that person wills, that tries their best to give as much resources as they need for them to learn what they want. This is of the purpose of increasing a persons autonomy.
