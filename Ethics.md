# This is my current belief of ethics

## Defininitions

"Doing good" = increasing dignity - eg giving a compliment

"Respect" = preserving dignity (ie, not reducing a persons dignity). Doing something respectful for one person is identicly respectful if doing that exact same action for another person - if you think it is respectful to bow down to the elderly, then you must also bow down to "respectable" people, black people, children, asians, and normal people. (I'm joking, they are all normal)

"Disrespect" = reducing dignity of a person

"Person": I'm using the word "person", but you may extend this to include other animals too.

## Rules

* Every person must have the most amount of dignity that can be had simultaneously.
* Disrespect includes controling people (taking away their autonomy), unless it is to stop disrespect. Along with this, increasing a persons autonomy, unless it is so they can disrespect, is doing good.
        - To be more precise, the controling of a person is inversly proportional to dignity of a person *or* the autonomy of a person is proprtional to the dignity of a person.

## Notes

Is controling wrong because it causes suffering? If so, then how is this different to utilitarianism?

Vectors are useful to explain control, except rather than a direction, a person is used. A vector going in a direction would represent disrespecting a person, while a vector is going in the opposite direction to that vector to cancel it out, it is doing good, but if it's magnitude is larger than that other vector, it is controling too much. I do not know if it is possible to attribute a number to a magnitude, but you should be able to tell if the magnitude of one vector is be=igger or smaller than another (ie if a person is disrespecting more or less than another)

Autonomy may be right because then you can get whatever you intrinsicly want. We don't just intrinsicly want plesure which is why *Brave New World* and the experiance machine is unappealing. Bernard Marx wants things other than what he is getting and so is unsatisfied, and the person in the experiance machine is only experiancing fulfilling what ever they are intrinsicaly motivated by, but don't actually fulfil it.

## Examples

**I should warn that it may not be best to read on if you have experianced any trumatic event.**

* Lies are wrong, unless it is to stop disrespect.
* Killing a person is wrong because their autonomy is taken away (because they're dead) and you take dignity away by makeing them suffer (that is, if they suffer)
* Rape is wrong because you take away autonomy and massivly decrease dignity.
* Children do not have the ablitity to make choices that they actually do truly want. That is why parents, who have a better understanding of the world and have more developed brains, make desisions for them. 
* If abortion is wrong because the future person won't be able to do stuff, becaue they won't exist, then a male wearing pants that are too tight would be unethical - you always have the chance to create life. And so it boils down to personhood - abortion is only wrong if what is killed is a person.
* If there was a person that could be killed to harvest the organs to save 5 people, then you are disrespecting that person by killing them.
* All people must have an education, which should be compulsory, so that they learn what is essential for life - eg mathamatics, reading&writing, phychology, health, ethics&empathy, science (scientific method, understanding facts&statistics) etc - along with introductions on other things so that they may see what interests them. After that, a secondary education may be taken if that person wills, that tries their best to give as much resources as they need for them to learn what they want. This is of the purpose of increasing a persons autonomy.
